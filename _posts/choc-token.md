## The Chocolate Token (CHOC)

The native token of the chocolate ecosystem is the Chocolate Token (CHOC).  
  
The Chocolate Token (CHOC), a token based on a Substrate blockchain, is an important element of a new security model. Substrate, the framework behind the Polkadot token, enables developers to build purpose-specific blockchains. The Chocolate team chose Substrate because of its capabilities and we intend to connect our parachain to the Polkadot / Kusama Network relay chain. Beyond enabling the Chocolate to connect the parachain to the existing Polkadot / Kusama relay chain, Chocolateâ€™s parachain will also benefit from the security provided by the relay chain.  
  
CHOC will, at the early stages, be specifically tied to the chocolate platform, along with the appropriate governance and oversight processes. Fraud will be prevented or reduced by publication of source code and cryptographically secure transactions. CHOC issuance to individual users will also be rate-limited and tied to active review and security audit.
